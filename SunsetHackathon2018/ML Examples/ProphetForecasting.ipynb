    "[Prophet](https://facebookincubator.github.io/prophet/) is an open source forecasting tool built by Facebook.  It can be used for time series modeling and forcasting trends into the future.  Prophet is interesting because it's both sophisticated and quite easy to use, so it's possible to generate very good forecasts with relatively little effort or domain knowledge in time series analysis.\n",

    "There are a few requirements you'll need to meet in order to use the library.  It uses PyStan to do all of its inference, so PyStan has to be installed.  PyStan has its own dependencies, including a C++ compiler.  Python 3 also appears to be a requirement.  Full installation instrutions are [here](https://facebookincubator.github.io/prophet/docs/installation.html).\n",

    "Let's take a quick tour through Prophet's capabilities.  We can start by reading in some sample time series data.  In this case we're using Wikipedia page hits for Peyton Manning, which is the data set that Facebook collected for the library's example code."

It essentially does all of the model selection work for you and gives you a result that works well without much user input required.  In this case we didn't have to specify anything at all, just give it some data and we get a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll explore below what the model looks like but it's worth spending a moment first to explain what's going on here.  Unlike typical time-series methods like ARIMA (which are considered generative models), Prophet uses something called an additive regression model.  This is essentially a sophisticated curve-fitting model.  I haven't dug into any of the math, but based on the description in their [introductory blog post](https://research.fb.com/prophet-forecasting-at-scale/), Prophet builds separate components for the trend, yearly seasonality, and weekly seasonality in the time series (with holidays as an optional fourth component).  We can witness this directly by looking at one of the undocumented properites on the model object that shows the fitted parameters."

    "I think the beta, delta, and gamma arrays correspond to the distributions for the three different components.  The way I think about this is we're saying we have three different regression models with some unknown set of parameters, and we want to find the combination of those models that best explains the data.  We can attempt to do this using maximum a-priori (MAP) estimation, where our priors are the equations for the regression components (piecewise linear for the trend, Fourier series for the seasonal component, and so on).  This appears to be what Prophet is doing.  I can't say I've looked at it in any great detail so part of that explanation could be wrong, but I think it's broadly correct.\n",

One very simple and obvious thing that's needed is a way to evaluate the forecasts.  We can do this ourselves using scikit-learn's metrics (you could also calculate it yourself).

    "Another limitation is the lack of ability to incorporate additional information into the model.  One can imagine variables that could be used along with the time series to further improve the forecast (for example, a variable indicating if Peyton Manning had just won a game, or had a particularly good performance, or appeared in some news articles).  We can't do anything like this with Prophet directly.  However, one idea I've experimented with in the past that may get around this limitatoin is building a two-stage model.  The first stage is the Prophet model, and we use that to generate predictions.  The second stage is a normal regression model that includes the additional signals as independent variables.  The wrinkle is that instead of predicting the target directly, we predict the <b>error</b> from the time series model.  When you put the two together, this may result in an even better overall forecast.\n",
    "\n",
    "All things considered, Prophet is a great addition to the toolbox for time series problems.  There are a number of knobs and dials that one can tweak that I didn't get into because I still haven't tried them out, but they provide options for advanced users to improve their forecasts even further.  It's worth cautioning that this software is fairly immature so proceed carefully if using it for any serious tasks.  That said, the authors claim Facebook uses it extensively so take that for what it's worth."
